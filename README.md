# Django Blog Project

This project is a personal blog developed using Python and Django. It was initially created as part of a course, but I've decided to continue the development independently. The project is not yet complete, but it's a work in progress.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes several exciting technologies and professional features:

- **Python/Django**: The main language and framework used for developing the blog.
- **Docker**: Used for setting up the development environment, which simplifies the project setup process.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for creating the website's frontend.

## Current Project Status

The development of the project is ongoing. Initially, I was following a course, but I found it more exciting to explore the documentation and learn independently. Therefore, I've decided to continue the development of the blog on my own.

## Known Issues

Please note that the image resizing functionality is currently not working. This issue is on my radar, and I plan to address it in future updates.

## Future Plans

I plan to continue developing this blog independently, exploring more features and technologies along the way. Stay tuned for more updates!
